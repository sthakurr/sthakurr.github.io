I am Saumya Thakur, currently working as an <b>AI Architect</b> at Accenture Japan. Before moving to Japan, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's in Chemistry from the <b>Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</b>. During those 5 years, I worked on various applications of AI architectures in chemical problems and gained experience in approaching important chemical problems using a data-driven and AI-based mindset. Consequently, I got passionate about the potential of AI architectures in diverse chemical problems amd worked on a variety of projects including generative AI, inverse chemical design, data-intensive formulations, graph networks and a few others. 

Even though I have had a very scattered experience in this regime of AI in Science, I am particularly interested in the aspects of <b>Generative AI</b> in achieving <b>Inverse Chemical Design</b>, 

Apart from the above, I have been living in Japan for almost an year now and I am involved in the backend development and maintenance of an internal translation tool. I work with various <b>Speech-to-text APIs</b> and gained first-hand experience and understanding of the <b>Software Development Cycle</b>. I got to augment my technical skillset with various technologies including Cloud services (AWS in particular), Typescript programming, API integrations, and more. It provided me with an excellent opportunity to engage in a real-life software development and learn the production-grade programming practices. I also look forward to obtaining the cloud certification soon in the coming months. 

<i>However, currently, I am actively seeking PhD positions to forekick my career in the field of AI for Science and employ my knowledge from my past experiences to some new exciting projects.</i>
