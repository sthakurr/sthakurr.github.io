I am Saumya Thakur, currently working as an AI Architect at Accenture Japan. Before moving to Japan, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's in Chemistry from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. During those 5 years, I worked on various applications of AI architectures in chemical problems and gained experience in approaching important chemical problems using a data-driven and AI-based mindset. Consequently, I got passionate about the potential of AI architectures in diverse chemical problems amd worked on a variety of projects including generative AI, data-intensive formulations, graph networks and a few others. 

Apart from the above, I have been living in Japan for almost an year now and I am responsible for the backend development and maintenance of an internal translation tool. I work with various Speech-to-text APIs and gained first-hand experience and uderstanding of the Software Development Cycle. I got to augment my technical skillset with various technologies including Cloud services (AWS in particular), Typescript programming, API integrations, and more. It provided me with an excellent opportunity to engage in a real-life software development and learn the production-grade programming practices. I also look forward to obtaining the cloud certification soon in the coming months. 

<i>However, currently, I am actively seeking PhD positions to forekick my career in the field of AI for Science and employ my knowledge from my past experiences to sme new exciting projects.</i>
