# About Me (personal version, apart from academics)

"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." - Albus Dumbledore

Hii! I am Saumya Thakur, born and brought up in New Delhi, the capital state of India. I completed my studies from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. These two dream cities of India has shaped the most important years of my life and I could not be any more grateful.
