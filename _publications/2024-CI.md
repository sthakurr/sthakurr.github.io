excerpt: 'Conical intersection (CI) leads to fast electronic energy transfer. However, Hamm and Stock [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 173201 (2012)] showed the existence of a vibrational CI and its role in vibrational energy relaxation. In this paper, we further investigate the vibrational energy relaxation using an isolated model Hamiltonian...'
