9th Feb ‚Äò22, 10:04 AM: Exactly when I received the selection mail from MITACS for a summer internship at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver and oh how I jumped out of my chair! Hello, I am Saumya and I graduated from IIT Bombay in May '23 with an Integrated Dual Degree (BS + MSc) in Chemistry. Writing this piece is surely going to be a rollercoaster trip down memory lane for me. It all began when things started to come to their normal pace after 2 years of COVID ‚Äò19. So, after those terrible years of retracted offers, a new hope towards foreign opportunities came in and I was one of those who chose to try their luck. Here, I pen down my experiences and learnings starting right from the application phase to submitting my final report of the project and bidding adieu to Canada and I really hope this is helpful to many aspiring for a similar experience.

In Sep ‚Äò21, MITACS had the deadline for their Globalink Internships. For those who are new to this, it is a fully-funded 3-month research internship in some of the top universities in Canada. They list down projects on their website (~3000 projects at my time) offered by different professors and during the application stage, the applicants are supposed to fill in 7 preferences. It covers a wide variety of topics and is not just limited to primary and natural sciences. After the application deadline, the ‚ÄòMatching Phase‚Äô begins where professors either directly select applicants or call them for an interview as the final phase. It is definitely a competitive program owing to the minimal success percentage, but this is where I‚Äôd like to quote my biggest learning: ‚ÄòBe conscious, you never know when a life-changing opportunity might knock your doors!‚Äô Don‚Äôt be afraid of the consequences and give it a shot because, as the famous saying goes, ‚ÄúYou lose 100% of the chances you don‚Äôt take.‚Äù I got to know about this program from one of my juniors who sent me his SoP to review and who would ever think that this small click will be my chance. I knew about MITACS, but I never gave it a thought, and I probably misunderstood that I was not eligible because I had converted to Dual-degree. I was unclear about the rules, but while checking his answers, I browsed the eligibility page and found out I was eligible. More than that, this happened just a day before the deadline so yes, I arranged for all the documents and wrote my SoP in a day for MITACS and had little to no hope. But I was satisfied because I did my part and left the rest to destiny (ofcourse xD). There were people who told me that it‚Äôs really competitive when I was applying but back to what I said earlier, I‚Äôd have lost a 100% chance if I wouldn‚Äôt have applied. Alright, the application is completed, and I was put on the waitlist!   

Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan,‚Ä¶. and I had forgotten about it and started apping by sending direct emails to professors. I had bagged few more internships during that time, but all of them were remote and unpaid internships. Feb came, and I received an email titled ‚Äò2022 Globalink Research Internship offer‚Äô asking me to accept or decline the project offer! I never even dreamed of this, but yes, there it was!!! I remember reading the mail thrice to confirm my acceptance. The cherry on top was the project I was selected for. It was my first preference in one of Canada‚Äôs top-ranked universities, The University of British Columbia!! I was beyond thrilleddd! Feb end, I received the final offer letter, and I started preparing for my first international internship (and trip).

Here begins the third phase of my blog, the preparations and challenges. I had no experience at all in international travel, and I was almost on my own, arranging for each and everything. I made a bunch of mistakes too, but as of today, I embrace my mistakes more than the things I did perfectly. Doing things right gave me experience and confidence, but mistakes provided me with learnings! The checklist can be summarised with these four major things: VISA, Flight tickets, accommodation and packing. Due to excitement, I forgot to confirm the process and booked my flight tickets way in advance in March first week itself. I applied for VISA next week after collecting all the documents mentioned. Canadian Visitor VISA usually has a huge waitlist, and it was more than 90 days at that time. I was definitely out of time considering that. To add on, I had another major issue owing to my name discrepancy in my passport and flight tickets. To further add, I had another problem with my return connecting flight in Japan. I had an inter-airport transfer within Tokyo, and Japan was not even providing Transit visas to Indians at that time (COVID times yes). I booked the tickets through a third-party website and statistically, their customer service never responded. VISA was secondary for me then as these issues wouldn‚Äôt let me sleep, considering I had already paid 74k INR. The months of March and April were extremely stressful, but I kept on trying to find solutions. My tickets were from Japan Airlines, and they were not reachable on their outsource contact numbers. I contacted the Japanese Embassy for help back then, and they gave me their sales team contacts, who kept asking me to contact the third-party website. They never responded; however, after multiple requests, the Airlines considered my request and assured me the boarding passes and the rerouting of the return flight. Also, this was probably the most hectic semester I had and the activities ended on the 6th of May while I was supposed to leave on the 9th. I left for Delhi on the 6th and had two days for packing where I had a basic checklist ready and we could finish it in time. They were majorly clothes, some ready-to-eats (not utensils), personal care and documents.

9th May and I boarded my first ever international flight from IGI and I had these mixed emotions all the time. Scared but excited, excited but scared!! However, Japan Airlines has been a savior in my journey and I‚Äôd honestly recommend it anytime. And finally, after two flights of 7 hours each and an 11hr layover in Japan, I landed in Vancouver, my dreamland!! I could not believe it, really. I finally made it to Van. As much as I was feeling a foreigner there, I couldn‚Äôt feel more homely when I heard the announcements in Punjabi xD Immigration was a bit tough as the officer there would just not agree to the funding by MITACS, but okay, I passed it. I had some cash handy, so took an in-line cab to the campus witnessing the beautiful green land and scenic views all along the way. Uber was also an option, but I did not have roaming activated on my phone, so I could not book one. Finally, I reached the place where I had my accommodation, the Marine Drive Residence lol. I had sublet it from a university student (loved the concept of subletting there) for three months, and it cost me around 720 CAD for my stay. The residence was inside the campus, only 7 min walking distance from my Department. Very convenient, with mesmerising views (attaching one of those here), and I had three roommates, too, as it was a 4-BR apartment.

The next morning, I went to my lab for my Day 1, and my professor was soo welcoming, gave me a tour all around the department and also provided me with tips on surviving. We then had our first project discussion along with a PhD student in the lab who was my project mentor. They had a basic idea that we made concrete with discussions and plans. I could first-hand experience how a basic research idea is worked upon with the available tools in the industry and how the challenges are tackled. One of the other novel things I learned in this project is that sometimes very novel ideas might not feel worthy enough to be worked out, but all the foundational science concepts were once doubted upon! So, this project was a way for me to validate the worth of a concept using statistical tools. I was more than excited to embark on this new journey, exploring both the project and Vancouver. The working hours were flexible, and added flexibility was there due to the computational aspect, but I tried getting to the lab by 9, sometimes even 8, but at max by 10 usually. The project basically involved devising a ‚ÄòGenerality‚Äô metric for the catalysts that will be a measure of how ‚Äògeneral‚Äô a catalyst is in its performance. We brainstormed the factors that need to be included in the equation and how they should be placed in the equation, how these values should be calculated from the data, how to tackle the skewed data problem, etc. My mentor had great statistical intellect and always had exciting ideas to work on. Initially, I worked on implementing those ideas and later incorporated mine, too, with all the experience I‚Äôve had in the field. Further, we validated the whole pipeline with another predictive model. So, the whole project was based on researching a metric using the available literature and validating the proposed metric with statistical tools, which made it self-consistent! I also got the chance to present my work in front of the group twice during the internship and made a consolidated report at the end. I am really glad to mention that this project, after some experimental validation, was eventually submitted to the Journal of the American Chemical Society as a research article and is currently under evaluation.

Work aside, I‚Äôd now love to get to the exciting and challenging parts of my workation! The fundamental challenges that come along when we go to a new country are food, social changes and cultural differences. Thankfully, language was never a problem for me; in fact, I often heard people on the streets talking in Hindi and Punjabi (Kaneda, of course, xD). About food, I definitely took some ready-to-eats and raw stuff from India, but I didn‚Äôt have the right set of utensils to prepare the food every time. Slowly and steadily, I found the alternatives and the concept of ‚Äòfrozen food‚Äô and Walmart, the heaven for Indians in Canada. I experienced both offline and online shopping since it used to be a bit far. Also, I have been lucky enough to always be on the lookout for coupons lol so I easily survived using Subway, DoorDash and Walmart coupons. Next, about the city, I cannot forget to mention what a beautiful blend of a stay Vancouver has been to me. Mountains, beaches, city life, nightlife, you can legit find everything in this lovely city.

Gladly, I found the sweetest bunch of friends to hang out with (we are still in great touch), fun labmates to go out on hikes with, most helpful mentor who lent me her Canadian Jacket for the first few weeks xD, and amazing cross-culture friends to learn more about their states! I once had a crocheting session where another intern from America taught me how to crochet from scratch (she was such a great teacher!) and when I was leaving another co-intern from HongKong gifted me with a crocheted granny square (I got so emooo). I can say that I could really explore Vancouver in such a short span of time, I still remember some of the bus routes and numbers.

Moreover, there used to be many social events, which were a great way to connect with the other interns. I could not attend many of them, but would definitely suggest any future intern: go to those VIRS meetups and be open. Regarding the cultural differences, the place was itself very culturally rich, and hence, it didn‚Äôt really feel foreign there. In fact, my professor was from the UK, and I had labmates who were Chinese and Irani. I remember a fun event where one of my Chinese labmates described an Indian street food as ‚Äòcrispy balls with a green filling‚Äô. Yes, he meant our favourite ‚Äògol gappas‚Äô, ‚Äòpani puri‚Äô, ‚Äòpuchkas‚Äô <3 I got numerous stories about the whole stay, and I am always enthusiastic about narrating them, so feel free to contact me ever if you wanna know about anything. In the end, I would love to thank my parents, my boyfriend, my girlfriends and all the friends and seniors who supported me throughout the journey and experience. I still cannot get over those 3 months and would love to relive them again and again ü§©
